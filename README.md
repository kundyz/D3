# Data Journalism and D3

Task
* You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Age or Smokers vs. Poverty.
* Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
* Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.
* Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
